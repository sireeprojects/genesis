This prototype end with build_baseline_pkt;
VLAN and MPLS headers are maintained in seperate containers
    having seperate containers increased the code complexity
    hence, deciding to limit the number of VLAN and MPLS headers to 32
    this means VLAN and MPLS need not be maintained in seperate containers
    next version will implement single container method
